# TS-JWT-SecureAPI

This project, TS-JWT-SecureAPI, serves as a testament to my proficiency in TypeScript. Through meticulous design and implementation, I have integrated JWT authentication into the backend, leveraging a robust Node structure.

# Key Features
- JWT Authentication
JSON Web Token is employed to secure routes, allowing seamless user authentication. Each request is meticulously validated, ensuring access only to authenticated users.

- Data Security
With JWT in place, this API guarantees that specific users can access their data securely. Robust verification processes are implemented, enabling efficient and safe retrieval of user-specific information.

- Prisma ORM Integration
The project utilizes Prisma ORM to create a sophisticated database. Prisma facilitates seamless execution of tailored queries, enhancing the efficiency and flexibility of the application.
